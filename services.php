From upgrading your operating system, to rebuilding your master boot record, to tutoring, we can help. For most of our services we charge $69.99 initial in-home troubleshooting along with a $29.99 charge per additional hour.  If the problem is too severe or would take too much of your own time, our technicians will advise you to let us take the defective system back to our shop to work on for only $99.99 without having to pay the initial home charge.  Although these are our basic prices, Phoenix Tech understands that each individual computer problem is unique, and we're therefore willing to negotiate our prices depending on the severity of your problem.  Please give us a call at one of our phone lines to find out the exact price quote for you.
